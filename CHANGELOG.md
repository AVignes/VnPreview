idea:

assets strategy.. 
we need to know folders with assets
and files at root

in VnPreviewAction:
- what if we read dist/app
- store a list of all files on root + folders
  => .well-known/vn-preview-assets.json

=> 
NO maintenance
real 404s 


still:
problem if we have assets co-located with components
deep inside routes... 

but it should work pretty well for vendanor use cases?
